# Uber-Nairobi-Ambulance-Perambulation-Challenge
We’ve have been given an information on thousands of traffic accidents that have occurred in Nairobi, Kenya in 2018 and 2019 identified by World Bank DIME research team and by Flare.  Using the training data set, we have to find locations for 6 ambulances every 3 hours over the test period. For each crash recorded, we will find the distance from that crash to the nearest ambulance according to our scheduled locations.   Using the supplementary data from Uber Movement, road survey data and weather patterns, we have to identify patterns of risk across the city.  The final score is the total distance travelled (in decimal degrees) by all ambulances over the entire test period.  The goal is to place the 6 ambulances in such locations that the final score is minimum
